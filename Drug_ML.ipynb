    "\n",
    "This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to classify the type of drug a patient should be prescribed, based on their medical attributes. The dataset contains anonymized patient information and the corresponding drug type that was prescribed.\n",

    "The goal is to preprocess the data, explore it visually and statistically, build a classification model, and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.\n",
